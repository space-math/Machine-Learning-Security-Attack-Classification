# Using a Structured Composition of Correlation Coefficient	 Functions to Optimize the Performance of Machine Learning based Security Attack Classification

## Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine an area of research that has not been explored yet. In this paper, we aim to explore the effectiveness of using a structured composition of correlation coefficient functions to optimize the performance of Machine Learning based Security Attack Classification. 

## Coding Files Explanation
- `CIC-UNSW-NB15-Analysis.ipynb`: This `.ipynb` file includes complete implementation of the proposed feature selection algorithm on the dataset. First, we extracted the data from the dataset (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/cic-unsw-nb15.html). Then, we performed data preprocessing and selected useful features using the proposed feature selection algorithm. Based on this, we trained 4 different types of models, and judged these models on various metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Mean Absolute Error, Training time, and Size of the model.
- `CICIDS2017-Analysis.ipynb`: This `.ipynb` file includes complete implementation of the proposed feature selection algorithm on the dataset. First, we extracted the data from the dataset (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html). Then, we performed data preprocessing and selected useful features using the proposed feature selection algorithm. Based on this, we trained 4 different types of models, and judged these models on various metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Mean Absolute Error, Training time, and Size of the model.
- `CICIoV2024_Multi_Class_Classification-Analysis.ipynb`: This `.ipynb` file includes complete implementation of the proposed feature selection algorithm on the dataset. First, we extracted the data from the dataset (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iov-dataset-2024.html). Then, we performed data preprocessing and selected useful features using the proposed feature selection algorithm. Based on this, we trained 4 different types of models, and judged these models on various metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Mean Absolute Error, Training time, and Size of the model.

## Getting Started
The best way to get started with performing experiments would be to gather the dataset files from the website of the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/). Once you have downloaded the datasets, you would have to decide whether you would want to use your local computer or Google Colab (https://colab.google/) to perform experiments. I used google colab to perform the experiments. Once done with these steps, you can go ahead and run the work that we have accomplished.

## Performing Experiments with the Proposed Feature Selection Algorithm
You can try using our proposed Feature Selection Algorithm for any of your own work as well. The code for the proposed feature selection algorithm is provided in each of the three `.ipynb` files. Please don't forget to cite our work, if you end up using it.
